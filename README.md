# 🚀 Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to install and run the project.

---

## 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zayd3030/FrontendCW.git
cd FEWD2526-cwbackend-update
```

## 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Inside the backend folder, install all required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This installs all necessary Node modules listed in `package.json` (including Express and CORS).

### 3️⃣ Run the Backend Server
Start the backend server locally:

```bash
node index.js
```

### 4️⃣ Set Up and Run the Frontend
Navigate to your React frontend folder:

```bash
cd ../family-organiser-frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Vite will start a local development server, usually on:
```
http://localhost:5173/
```

Open that link in your browser to view your React app.  
Ensure both servers are active:

- **Backend:** http://localhost:3001  
- **Frontend:** http://localhost:5173  

If the frontend fetches data from the backend successfully then the setup is complete.

### 5️⃣ Push Your Project to GitHub
Once everything works, commit and push your code:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial setup for Family Organiser CW1"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
